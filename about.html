<p>Hi! My name is Zahra and Iâ€™m currently a senior studying information science and writing. I'm not too sure what my plans are for after I graduate but I should probably figure that out soon. I do love what I'm studying right now and I'm just focused on learning more and gaining new experiences. 

<p>I really love traveling. One of my favorite places I have travelled has been Sydney, Australia. The nature and scenery there is truly unbeatable. I loved hiking to a high place and watching the sunset every night. After I graduate I plan on taking some time to travel to more places all around the world.</p>
<p>Some of my interests include:
<ul><li>Painting</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Movies</li>
<li>Traveling</li>
<li>Going to Museums</li>
</ul></p></body>
